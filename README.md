## Updating Formulas

When releasing new versions of your software, you can easily update the formulas in this tap:

### Automatic Update (Recommended)

Use the provided update script:

```bash
./update_formula.sh <version>
```

For example, to update threefingers to version 1.0.3:
```bash
./update_formula.sh 1.0.3
```

This script will:
- Download the new release tarball
- Calculate the SHA256 hash automatically
- Update the formula with the new version, URL, and hash

### Manual Update

If you prefer to update manually:

1. Update the `version` field in the formula
2. Update the `url` to point to the new release
3. Calculate and update the `sha256` hash:
   ```bash
   curl -sL "https://github.com/geongeorge/threefingers/archive/refs/tags/v<VERSION>.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256
   ```

### Testing Updates

After updating a formula, test it locally:
```bash
brew install --build-from-source ./Formula/threefingers.rb
```
